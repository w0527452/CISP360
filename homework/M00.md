C. float b = a / 3.14;  
D. int a = b - 8;  (assuming b is an int as defined above) 
E. int a = 27;  
F. unsigned char c = 'K';  
G. unsigned char x = 'B'; short c = x;  
```

Modified:
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
        cout << "Two mandolins like creatures in the\n\n\n";
        cout << "dark" << endl << endl << endl;
        cout << "Creating the agony of ecstasy.\n\n\n";
        cout << "                 George Barker\n\n\n";

        return 0;
}
```
  
## True/False

22\. TRUE -  A variable must be defined before it can be used.  
23\. FALSE - Variable names may begin with a number.  
24\. FALSE - Variable names may be up to 31 characters long.  
25\. TRUE -  A left brace in a C++ program should always be followed by a right brace later in the program.  
26\. FALSE - You cannot initialize a named constant that is declared with the const modifier.
