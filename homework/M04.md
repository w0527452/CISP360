# M04 Assignment

## Algorithm Workbench #44 - 46

### \#44 - Write code that does the following: Opens an output file with the filename Numbers.txt, uses a loop to write the numbers 1 through 100 to the file, then closes the file.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ofstream outputFile;
    cout << "Opening file\n";
    outputFile.open("Numbers.txt");
    if (outputFile) {
        for (int n = 1; n <= 100; n++) {
            cout << "writing " << n << endl;
            outputFile << n << endl;
        }
        cout << "closing file\n";
        outputFile.close();
    } else {
        cout << "Error opening file\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

\pagebreak

### \#45 - Write code that does the following: Opens the Numbers.txt file that was created by the code you wrote in question 44, reads all of the numbers from the file and displays them, then closes the file.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream inputFile;
    cout << "Opening file\n";
    inputFile.open("Numbers.txt");
    if (inputFile) {
        int number;
        while (inputFile >> number) {
            cout << number << endl;
        }
        inputFile.close();
    } else {
        cout << "Error opening file\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

\pagebreak

### \#46 - Modify the code that you wrote in Question 45 so it adds all of the numbers read from the file and displays their total.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream inputFile;
    cout << "Opening file\n";
    inputFile.open("Numbers.txt");
    if (inputFile) {
        int number, total = 0;
        while (inputFile >> number) {
            total += number;
        }
        cout << "Total is " << total << endl;
        inputFile.close();
    } else {
        cout << "Error opening file\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
