# M13 | Assignment

## Short Answer 9 - 16

### 9\. Under what circumstances should a member function be private?

When the func is needed for internal processing but not needed outside the class.

### 10\. What is a constructor? What is a destructor?

Constructors run when an object is instantiated.  Used to initiate member vars and other setup.

Destructors run when an object is destroyed.

### 11\. What is a default constructor? Is it possible to have more than one default constructor?

A constructor that requires no args.  Only possible to have one default constructor.

### 12\. Is it possible to have more than one constructor? ls it possible to have more than one destructor?

Constructor, yes.  Destructor, no.

### 13\. If a class object is dynamically allocated in memory, does its constructor execute? lf so, when?

Yes, when the new keyword is used to define the pointer.

### 14\. When defining an array of class objects, how do you pass arguments to the constructor for each object in the array?

If a constructor requires more than one argument, the initializer must take the form of a function call.

### 15\. What are a class's responsibilities?

The things the class is responsible for knowing, and actions the class must perform.

### 16\. How do you identify the classes in a problem domain description?

Nouns

\pagebreak

## Algorithm Workbench 46 - 49

### 46\. Write a statement that defines an array of five objects of the Circle class in Question 45. Let the default constructor execute for each element of the array.

``Circle circles[5];``

### 47\. Write a statement that defines an array of five objects of the Circle class in Question 45. Pass the following arguments ro the elements' constructor: 12, 7, 9, 14, and 8.

``Circle circles[] = { 12, 7, 9, 14, 8 };``

### 48\. Write a for loop that displays the radius and area of the circles represented by the array you defined in Question 47

```
for ( Circle c : circles ) {
     cout << c.getRadius() << endl;
}
```

### 49\. If the items on the following list appeared in a problem domain description, which would be potential classes?

\* Animal   
Inoculate  
\* Doctor  
\* Patient  
\* Medication  
Operate  
\* Invoice  
\* Client  
\* Nurse  
Advertise  
Measure  
\* Customer  

## True or False 59 - 72

* 59\. False - A private member function may be called from a statement outside the class, as long as the statement is in the same program as the class declaration.
* 60\. False - Constructors do not have to have the same name as the class.
* 61\. True - Constructors may not have a return type.
* 62\. False - Constructors cannot take arguments.
* 63\. True - Destructors cannot take arguments.
* 64\. False - Destructors may return a value.
* 65\. True - Constructors may have default arguments.
* 66\. True - Member functions may be overloaded.
* 67\. False - Constructors may not be overloaded.
* 68\. True - A class may not have a constructor with no parameter list, and a constructor whose arguments all have default values.
* 69\. True - A class may only have one destructor.
* 70\. False - When an array of objects is defined, the constructor is only called for the first element.
* 71\. False - To find the classes needed for an object-oriented application, you identify all of the verbs in a description of the problem domain.
* 72\. True - A class's responsibilities are the things the class is responsible for knowing, and actions the class must perform.

## Find the Errors 75, 76

### 75. I'm going with FIX the errors.
```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class DumbBell {
    int weight;
public:
    void setWeight(int w) {
        this->weight = w;
    }

    int getWeight() {
        return this->weight;
    }
};

int main() {
    DumbBell *bar = new DumbBell();
    bar->setWeight(200);
    cout << "The weight is " << bar->getWeight() << endl;

    return 0;
}

```

### 76.  Got a little carried away on this one.

    cout << "sum: " << sum << endl;
