## Short Answer (1-5)

### 1\. What is a primitive data type?

Types that are defined as a basic part of the language.

### 2\. Does a structure declaration cause a structure variable to be created?

No.

### 3\. Both arrays and structures are capable of storing multiple values. What is the difference between an array and a structure?

Structs can hold values of multiple types.

### 4\. Look at the following structure declaration: 

```
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};
```

a.    Point center;
a.    center.x = 12;
a.    center.y = 7;
a.    cout << "x: " << center.x << " y: " << center.y << endl;

### 5\. Look at the following structure declaration:

```
struct FullName {
    string lastName;
    string middleName;
    string firstName;
}
```

a.    FullName info;
a.    info = { "Chouinard", "Alexander", "Mark" };
a.    cout << info.lastName << ' ' << info.middleName << ' ' << info.firstName << endl;

## Algorithm Workbench \#17

### The structure Car is declared as follows:
```
struct Car {
    string carMake;
    string carModel;
    int yearModel;
    double cost;
};
```
Write a definition statement that defines a Car structure variable initialized with the following data:  
Make: Ford  
Model: Mustang  
Year Model: 1968  
Cost: $20,000  

``Car ride = { "Ford", "Mustang", 1978, 20000 };``

## Find the Errors (45-48)

### 45\. Struct needs a name.

### 46\. Struct def should end with semi-colon.

### 47\. Needs to instantiate a new object instead of trying to assign values to the struct.

### 48\. Cannot cout an entire struct - have to cout each struct member individually.
